<h1> RA Resources and Tips </h1>

This is a conglomeration of resources that I found helpful in my long and meandering search for an RA position. In particular, this guide is designed for individuals who, like me, are coming from a small school with no name recognition and have little to no advice on how to obtain a quality RA position. The resources that I will list here are all resources that I found immensely helpful for me in my search process. If you're in a similar position to the one I was in, my hope is that this resource can give you some direction or, at a minimum, some comfort that you're not the only one. If you're killing the game and have professors spamming your email, pleading with you to please consider working with them, chances are you don't need this. Regardless, I hope that this proves to be useful for somebody, and if it doesn't, it's still therapeutic in a way for me to vomit out all the information I've gathered throughout the process. So, without further ado,

<h2> Where can I find open RA positions? </h2>

 - **NBER RA Positions**
 
 RA positions with NBER-affiliated faculty are pretty much the cream of the crop and are what you "should" be shooting for. A regularly updated list of open RA positions can be seen *here at the NBER website*. The RA application cycle peaks in the late fall/winter, but positions continue to open and be posted regularly through the early summer. This is undoubtedly the \#1 feed for RA positions.
 
 - **@econra Account on Twitter**
 
 This account does a fantastic job of retweeting active RA positions that are posted or announced on Twitter. Although there is a significant amount of overlap between this account and the NBER RA listings, there are quite a few that this account catches that don't get picked up on the NBER page.
 
 - **Others**
 
 If you regularly attend to the above two resources, you will cover 90% + (educated guess based on exceptional industry research done by me) of the available, high-quality RA positions. However, to capture whatever small percentage of RA positions may escape the snares of these two, the following websites can be helpful in filling the gaps: 
    - *insert anything relevant here*

<h2>What are researchers looking for in an RA?</h2>

- **Technical Skills**

 The reality is that, while having an economics background is nice and possibly helpful, the vast majority of sponsoring researchers are fine with, and are actively looking for, potential RAs that may lack economics training but are strong in technical skills. This is typically found in students emerging from a Math/Computer Science/Engineering background that are interested in pursuing further studies in Economics. What technical skills are they looking for in particular?

- **A Strong Math Background**

 For individuals coming from a STEM background, this pretty much comes with the territory. It's pretty much impossible to graduate with a degree in Math/CS/Engineering or something similar without having taken a bunch of pure/applied math courses.

 **"But what if I majored in a Social Science and am lacking a strong math background?"** The good news here is that this isn't the end of the world. Typically, with RA positions, math is used as a screening mechanism and a lack thereof can be easily overlooked in the presence of strong coding skills. In fact, an RA position can be a fantastic way to bulk up your math muscles, as many positions come with the benefit of being allowed to take classes for free at the sponsoring institution. In short, coding skills can absolutely make up for lacking math background, which leads to the next point.

- **Coding Skills**

 This is probably the single most important category for determining how easily you will be able to obtain a high-quality RA position. Coding will likely constitute the bulk of what you do as an RA and having the necessary skillset is essential. The primary languages currently used in Economics are as follows in order of importance:
    
 - **Stata:** 
    
   Although other languages (especially R) are dramatically increasing in popularity, Stata still has a chokehold on Economics as a whole. As such, it is definitely helpful to at least be able to (truthfully) claim a very basic knowledge of Stata. However, don't freak out. If you have never touched Stata, because you have never been previously involved in Economics research, and can't purchase it for yourself, because you aren't independently wealthy \*gasp\*, you aren't actually in too much of a bind.

 - **R:** 
    
   As previously mentioned, R is rapidly gaining a significant foothold in the great **Arena of Economics**. This is fantastic for a number of reasons. R is a powerful and flexible language, has tons of cutting edge packages, and has a phenomenal community online through sources such as *R-bloggers* and *Stack Overflow*.
    
 - **Python:**
   
   Python's biggest strengths are its extreme versatility and active development community. Although Python is more commonly used in software development and other more 'standard' CS environments, Economists use it for a variety of purposes, in particular its powerful ML capabilities.

 - **Matlab:**

   Although Matlab is probably the language here that is used the least commonly, it is still a staple for some researchers. Matlab is particularly optimized for mathematical purposes (duh) and can handle certain computational processes more elegantly than the other mentioned languages.

 - **Others**

   So, the primary take-away here is that if you want to secure a good RA position you are going to need to be fairly comfortable with at least one of the aforementioned languages. Are there other languages that would work? Certainly! The main issue is that all researchers will want to test your coding skills and many of them will want you to use a tool that they or one of their affiliates are familiar with. The vast majority of the time, that tool will be in the list above.

<h2>What coding will I be evaluated on?</h2>

The all important question. Every single evaluation process for a potential RA position will involve a coding test of some sorts if you make it past the initial screening process. While these coding tests will vary, they all have certain common themes.
   
- **Data Cleaning**
 Every coding task will either explicitly or implicitly involve some data cleaning. While this is pretty general, it basically will involve some sort of *merging*, *grouping*, *summarising*, *ordering*, *dealing with missing values*, *reading data files*, you name it. Once again, data cleaning can involve a lot of things, but the task will have it, so make sure your data cleaning skills are on point.

- **Data Visualisation**
 This typically isn't an explicit part of the coding assignment, but if your finished task doesn't involve some visualisations, it's probably not going anywhere. Visualisation is an essential part of the coding task and so you need to be proficient at least at a basic level with your software's visualisation tools.

- **Predictive Modeling**
 Of these three, this is probably the least important. Not in the sense that it isn't essential, but that the task at hand will typically require minimal knowledge of your software's predictive modeling tools, whereas the data cleaning portion can be pretty changelling depending on the task. Basically, if you know how to run linear and logistic regression and appropriately deal with measures of accuracy (e.g. maximizing AUC for a classification problem), you'll be fine. The hardest part here is understanding what type of modelling techniques are appropriate and interpreting results correctly. Most tasks explicitly caution you from going hog-wild on the modelling techniques, so if you find yourself running some Double-LASSO regressions you might want to take a step back and make sure you've nailed the fundamental parts of the task.
 
<h2>What if my coding skills aren't up to snuff?</h2>

Another piece of good news! This is also something that can be remedied, and if you're willing to devote time to it, you can probably improve quickly. I am by far the most familiar with R, so this will inevitably affect the resources I suggest here. Below I will list some resources for each language that I am at least somewhat familiar with.

- **R:** 

 **1)** *R for Data Science: Hadley Wickham*
 
   This is hands-down one of the best resources out there for anybody trying to rapidly improve their data cleaning and visualisation skills in R. Hadley Wickam, the R master himself, beautifully lays out the incredibly powerful *tidyverse* in a clear way with many, many code snippets and visuals along the way. Working quickly, you could work through this book in around a month and a half (give or take a month lol). With the tools learned in this book, you will be ready right off the bat to tackle 80% + of the data cleaning tasks thrown at you, and will have the fundamental tools to work out the rest with minimal emotional distress.
    
 **2)** *DataCamp Machine Learning Toolbox*
 
   The *Caret* package is essentially a wrapper package for a broad array of predictive modelling packages and algorithms in R. It allows the user to apply hundreds of different predictive models with a common syntactical interface. This course is best taken if you already have the underlying knowledge but simply need to learn how to implement predictive models in R.
   
 **3)** *Stack Exchange/Overflow*
   This is the treasure trove where you can find answers to every question you every had and every question you never thought to ask.
    
- **Stata:**

 **1)** *JPAL Stata Modules*
    
   Since Stata is proprietary software, free resources for getting up to speed are relatively limited compared to R and Python. However, JPAL does have Stata modules designed for *Beginner*, *Intermediate*, and *Advanced* Stata users. At the very least, this provides the opportunity for a complete noob to develop basic competency in Stata, which is a highly desirable trait. *Caveat*: You of course need access to Stata to do this, which is kind of a big assumption to make.
   
 **2)** *Complete Stata codebooks*
 
   Although these look like a beast to slog through (I haven't), they do contain all the information you could every want. So, if you have a large amount of time and emotional fortitude, these could be a fantastic resource. Also good as a troubleshooting reference.
   
 **3)** *StataList*
 
   Basically the Stack Overflow for Stata
   
- **Python**

 **1)** *Coursera Intro/Intermediate/Data Analysis Courses for Python*
 
   While my opinion on the value of online courses is somewhat tainted, these courses do a good job of getting you up to speed at a basic proficiency with data analysis in Python.
   
These resources should be enough to get a solid start in each of these languages. Beyond that, the world is your oyster if you have the desire. There are endless resources. Probably the most important piece of advice at the beginning is to focus on one language until you have acheived at least basic *fluency*. Don't branch off until you have at least one software that you can confidently and comfortably attack basic data cleaning, visualisation, and modeling tasks with little to no reference or help!
