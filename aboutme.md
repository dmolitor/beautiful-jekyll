- Currently serving as an RA to Dr. Justine Hastings with the hope of pursuing a PhD in Economics in the fall of 2022
- I'm not trained in CS but I find it fascinating, and I like to geek out about stuff I don't understand
- I'm a big fan of R and it's ecosystems, trying to learn Julia, and can hack away a bit in Python under threat of death

Personal Life Related

- I'm a âš¾ nerd (unsurprisingly)
- If it has discs involved, I'm down
- I'm one of 8 kids, and have an ever-expanding pool of (currently ~ 25) neices and nephews, so that's fun!
- I love to debate philisophical things, so if you want to get into a friendly argument about something I'm happy to oblige ðŸ˜‰
